## Current Role

### Data and business intelligence specialist with over 25 yearsâ€™ experience in college and university management

I began my career in the public sector with a humble start, shelving books in a college library. This experience, though modest, helped me lay the foundation for my future endeavours.

Over the years, I have taken on diverse roles in various organisations, expanding my experience from reports developer to director roles.

While data and information services are my main strengths, I am always eager to broaden my experience and assist wherever I can. In the education sector, particularly the public sector, resources are often limited. My ability to roll up my sleeves and get involved is one of my key attributes.

My journey has led me to explore ways to utilise data and help colleagues develop their business intelligence for marketing, student services, curriculum development, and other senior leadership challenges - reading the ILR and HESA specifications is something I just do in my spare time for fun.

After many years in information and leadership roles within education, I established my own business. I have since worked with many organisations, assisting them with data management, compliance, funding, statutory returns, audits, and much more.
