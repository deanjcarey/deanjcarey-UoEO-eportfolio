Age:

Mean: 26.51
Median: 27
Mode: 26


Median Diastolic Blood Pressure (dbp) by diabetic status:

Diabetic (diabetes = 1): 83.0 mm Hg
Non-diabetic (diabetes = 2): 82.0 mm Hg

Our diabetic and non-diabetic cases are two separate, unrelated groups therefore the Mann–Whitney test is specifically designed for independent samples such as these two groups.

Mann–Whitney U test: U = 3804.50, p = 0.7999

The medians differ by only 1 mm Hg and the p-value is large, indicating no statistically significant difference in BP between diabetic and non-diabetic groups.
