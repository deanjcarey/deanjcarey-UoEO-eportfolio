## Reflection on Units 6 to 12:
In Units 1 to 5, I was introduced to the basics of using R, including how to navigate RStudio, import data, and carry out descriptive statistics. I also learned about different data structures, how to explore and clean datasets, and how to perform simple statistical operations. Using R has been surprisingly straightforward—once I got used to the syntax, things like plotting data and manipulating variables became quite intuitive.

The course also covered probability and sampling methods, which were manageable with practice. However, when it came to calculus — particularly differentiation and integration — I found it much harder to grasp. Unlike the coding parts, which I could try out and see results instantly, the calculus concepts felt abstract, and I’m still not confident I fully understand them. I think I’ll need a lot more hands-on examples and practical applications before it really starts to make sense.
