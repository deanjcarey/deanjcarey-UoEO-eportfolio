## Reflection on Units 1 to 5:

Unit 1 lecturecast may need a review - in the The Four V's of Big Data, Veracity is mispelt at the very end of the clip as 'Voracity' - unless this was an interesting play on words trying to convey the huge appetite the modern world has, consuming vasts volumes of data :-)
Also in the Comma-Separated Values (lesson 16) the example for TSV appears to be an JSON snippet rather than tab seperated values.
