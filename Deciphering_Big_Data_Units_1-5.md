# Deciphering Big Data - Units 1-5

Reflections and any outputs/artifacts for activities can be seen in the unit sections below.

## Unit 1 - Introduction to Big Data Technologies and Data Management

This unit gave me a clear, practical introduction to big-data features (the 4Vs), common data formats and the real-world problems that make cleaning and managing large datasets difficult. The lecturecast and set readings helped me see where data-type issues and complex formats create bottlenecks and why choosing the right tools and security controls matters when designing a data management system. I watched the seminar recording (I missed the live session) and used the Collaborative Discussion to think through IoT data-collection risks and opportunities â€” low peer participation limited debate but my post helped me consolidate key risks and mitigation ideas. Overall, I feel more confident spotting data quality issues and understanding the basic skills and security requirements needed to build a reliable data pipeline.

Feedback notes - Unit 1 lecturecast may need a review - in the The Four V's of Big Data, Veracity is mispelt at the very end of the clip as 'Voracity' - unless this was an interesting play on words trying to convey the huge appetite the modern digital world has, consuming vasts volumes of data :-) Also in the Comma-Separated Values (lesson 16) the example for TSV appears to be an JSON snippet rather than tab seperated values.


## Unit 2 - Introduction to Data Types and Formats

This unit provided a strong theoretical foundation in how different data types - structured, quasi-structured, semi-structured and unstructured - affect storage choices, parsing logic and pipeline design. The seminar recording and required readings clarified why format-awareness matters for data veracity and value and prepared me to recognise when tools such as NoSQL, Hadoop and Spark are appropriate (Sardar and Pandey, 2024). Although I did not complete hands-on Python or API tasks in this unit, the material gave me the conceptual framework I can use when I carry out parsing and integration exercises in future activities. Overall I feel better equipped to plan data-movement workflows and choose appropriate platforms when I move from theory to practice.
