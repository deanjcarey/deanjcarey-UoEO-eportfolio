# Deciphering Big Data - Units 6-12

Reflections and any outputs/artifacts for activities can be seen in the unit sections below.

## Unit 6 - Database Design and Normalisation

This unit taught me the basics of relational design and why normalisation matters for integrity and auditability. The Unit 6 reading complemented this by showing practical work with real datasets - JSON and CSV handling, counting, filtering and grouping, wrangling and cleaning and using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation and inspection. 

Working on the Clinical Trials DB proposal helped us apply some of those ideas - we mapped logical tables to a physical schema, chose Third Normal Form to reduce redundancy and planned keys and constraints to protect relational integrity. We identified primary keys and considered where indexes or selective denormalisation might help performance but during the assignment we limited implementation to the core keys and constraints. We could consider adding further indexes or denormalisation after analysing query performance.

I also practised writing and testing SQL and validated my skills with a W3Schools quiz (23/25, 92%) which is included as evidence below:

Note: Lecturecast lesson 7 of 9 has a "Consent of the Class" which appears to be from a different topic/subject entirely - have submitted feedback via the link at end of lecturecast.
